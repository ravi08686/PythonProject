Problem statememet:
===================
In our prodject, for house keeping task we were continuously copying the json files and the questions part of those new products which pushed to prod.
Which is a manual task. We need to automate this process going forward.

As a first step I have created a python project where it will take the few details and save the files in the folder and get the qustions data in the csv file.
